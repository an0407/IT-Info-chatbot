Foundation Model Strategy & Customization
Evaluate and implement the right model mix â GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, or a hybrid â with full support for fine-tuning, quantization, and domain adaptation.
LLM Stack Architecture & Orchestration
Build GenAI platforms with vector DBs, retrieval pipelines, agent frameworks, grounding logic, and system prompts â all integrated with your cloud, data, and security baselines.
Evaluation Harnesses, Guardrails & Cost Controls
Design eval systems that monitor hallucinations, drift, bias, latency, and token usage â with customizable guardrails, prompt filters, and rollout gates.
Custom Copilots & Agentic Systems
Deploy tailored AI assistants for clinicians, analysts, support teams, or researchers â integrated into your systems (EHR, Salesforce, SAP, etc.) with safe autonomy and oversight.
Synthetic Data & Prompt Engineering Toolkits
Create edge-case coverage using synthetic data pipelines and iterate faster with versioned prompt libraries, embeddings tuning, and structured experimentation.
GenAI UX & Multimodal Interfaces
Design intuitive, context-aware interfaces â from chat-based flows and voice UIs to GenAI-enhanced dashboards.
Compliance, Observability & Continuous Learning
Hardwire governance into the loop with audit logs, HITL workflows, model upgrade paths, and compliance hooks for HIPAA, GxP, SOC 2, and AI Act readiness.
