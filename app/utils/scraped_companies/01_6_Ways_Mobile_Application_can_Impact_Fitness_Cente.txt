6 Ways Mobile Application can Impact Fitness Centers and Gyms
1. Personalized Workout Plans
As members lose weight and tone up, their plan adjusts accordingly. Some people also respond well to reminders about their morning workout – what it consists of, how long it should be. Figure out a long-term strategy with a member, schedule daily texts to go out just before their workout is due to begin and even add motivational texts that go out in the middle of the session.
2. Diet Plans
Creating a new, healthy, varied diet is one thing, sticking to it is more of a challenge. For some, just remembering what they’re supposed to be eating (and not eating) each day is tough. Scheduled alert messages can help people stay regimented.
3. Alerts
New gym members can be anxious about working out during busy times. They might be self-conscious about their weight or fitness levels, or shy about lifting weights next to Mr. Universe. Even regulars like to know how busy the gym is, so why not send mass texts when it’s particularly quiet?
4. Class Schedules
As the smartphone becomes an extension of a person, it works as a diary and personal organizer. One of the most effective mobile marketing ideas for fitness clubs is using alert to issue class schedules. It reduces the risk of annoyed members showing up for something that’s been cancelled, and improves retention rates.
5. Motivational Messages
According to Norman Augustine, ‘motivation will almost always beat mere talent.’ Sending out the occasional aphorism to gym-members is a good way stay engaged.
6. Promotions and Cross Marketing
Using Mobile app for fitness means taking a holistic approach to the needs of your client-base. If, for example, you have a semi-regular massage therapist with an uncertain schedule, you can create a list of members who used their services and let them know the next time they can book a session.
