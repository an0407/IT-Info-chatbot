Consumer Goods and Distribution
Connecting with the conscious consumer
Conscious consumers expect more than convenience. They want the products they buy to be ethically and sustainably sourced, produced, and distributed. For consumer goods companies, this means that, in addition to enabling pervasive commerce, they need to tailor their strategies to cater to these preferences. This shift in thinking is driving massive technology investments to accelerate consumer-first innovation, build resilient and responsible supply chains, and personalize experiences.
