The UI design should express the brand value of the company.
Its focus on how product look and feel
UI designers mainly focus on the visuals and quality of the end product, and they deal with the technicalities of the product design.
UI designers design prototypes in full color
UI designers use tools such as Sketch, Flinto, Principle, and InVision for image designing.
They have to add artistic element in their design, since it deals with what user sees, hear, and feels.
UX design:
User Experience is determined by how users interact with the app. It helps users to have a positive experience. The product must be easily usable, self-explanatory, and logical. It should solve the problem of users, and the product should be accessible and usable by more people. It must allow users to complete their tasks seamlessly.
It completely deals with user’s journey
UX designers focus mainly on the functionality and the purpose of the end product, and they do project management and analysis of the project.
UX designers design in black, grey, or white.
UX designers use Mockplus which is a wireframe-based prototype tool.
It has more of a social element, as it needs to know what the user wants to experience in the end product.
