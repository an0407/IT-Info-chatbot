Standardizing HR processes
A major goal of ONE’s digital strategy is to transform its human resources processes to improve the employee experience, enable employee self-service, enhance performance and create unified, end-to-end process management.
As DXC is supporting the company’s SuccessFactors HR software, ONE engaged DXC to implement additional modules of SuccessFactors for integrated management of all HR functions. DXC is helping ONE implement better processes for compensation, performance management and goal setting to help employees feel connected, supported and empowered — no matter where they’re based.
“We wanted to standardize HR processes with one system used by everyone in the organization globally for everything from recruiting and onboarding to performance management, compensation, learning and development, and succession planning,” Sze says. “This is a key initiative for us, as our people are one of our company’s biggest assets.”
