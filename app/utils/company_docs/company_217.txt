[Music] hello I'm Debbie bell hosking for finextra TV bringing you a thought leadership interview with Aon Jen chairman and managing director of intellect design Arena and we're going to be talking about Technologies and AI transforming banking Aaron a big welcome this is a great sofa to be chatting on thank you AR let's start off can I ask you from your point of view what are the unique challenges that are facing banking today um banking is facing two big areas we can Define the challenges one is the kind of a complexity of the Legacy Technologies which are sitting in the banks which are raising the cost of Technology substantially higher for the banks and secondly is a lot of tech lot of knowledge sitting in the documents so Bank have too much knowledge in which need to be converted using AI to be usable knowledge which bank can apply in their day-to-day work so these are two major spaces in which we can categorize banking challenge especially in Western countries is quite High absolutely and you talk about those Legacy systems you talk about the more current systems we got Legacy data that's right we've got Digital Data that's right and trying to bring them together that's right so how can this diverse data let's call it that be leveraged to make smarter decisions and actions in Key Banking processes and can you name perhaps some core technologies that are pushing this transformation yeah so I think there U we call it why Bank exist fundamentally there's a financial event happening in the life of the customer or a commercial organization which drives the bank to respond to and Bank responds to some Services they give it to the customer whether it's a deposit service Lending Service investment service or credit card service or a payment service these are Service Bank provides to the customer and then the service has to be connected to each other so we look at it events is a if you look at bank from a first principal thinking there are only five principles are there it is to be on events macros services technology world the what service Bank provides if I encode that service in technology form it's a micros service and if the interfaces between the Departments I can connect them together it become API and then it sits on a common infrastructure which we call cloud in today's vocabulary and you need to give a personalized service become the services which is given to the End customer and then you apply AI so we call this six principle called em. a each alphabet stand for the uh the principle for which new transformation can be led coming to data data is a core value of any AI there's a structured data and there is unstructured data structured data bank has leverage for quite some time now there are eight different Technologies for making unstructured data to talk to structured data and use generative Ai and the models which has evolved to create a value this is a deceptive technology what we have worked on from last 7 years is spending almost 16 million hours of the R&D work at intellect our Engineers has come out with it complete technology platform where Enterprises can consume this technology to drive a value from the data so you have to ingest the technology you have to classify the technology extract the technology exct the data and then make it trusted data these are four set of technology which we call document intelligence management system parall to the document database management system which we call DMS now we use generative AI expert agent to leverage this technology to Define and we Define personas of expert agents which could be relationship manager Persona ops manager Persona compliance manager Persona and we give them a data to all of them structured data and unstructured data to drive towards better recommendation what they think about the decision should be and that's for better decision making now if three people give a decisioning then obviously there will be contradictions to handle the contradiction we have built up a algorithm called socus dialogue with agents talk to each other like asking question to each other and from that they recommend the final recommendation so such technology we are using for some of the customer in UK some us customers are using our technology in this space so this is the change which is happening where we are using large language models whether but we are saying for every application in one of the application we have 13 agents and six models we are using from chat GPT to anthropic to bedrock so all these Technologies can be leveraged in a structured Manner and it sounds to me from what you're talking about is enhancing communication but also building that data Foundation this good data Foundation to move forward with the technology more than data Foundation decision systems so using data Foundation structured data and unstructured data leveraging to get into the right appropriate decisioning so that lot of banks are going through the substantial losses or the penalties from the regulator they can prevent those uh penalties because they can do a realtime check on the authenticity authenticity customer yeah and that real time is so important yeah let's now move on to risk management and compliance another element that's crucial to financial institutions so how can governance Frameworks enhance that trust transparency and Regulatory alignment yeah so it's a continuation of previous thing when we are looking at it since 70% of the docu data sits in a huge document the problem of Regulatory Compliance better decision making better transparency can only possible when I extract the right Knowledge from those documents in a structured fashion and I use agents of various natur today I can put manual a manual people to look at 500 page contract now even if he's a smartest person he'll not able to know the micro details in the document which AI can provide the capability so driving using the right generative AI in a right governance model so today generative AI is there we are using CH GPT in day-to-day life all of us use it but I cannot use for Enterprise application yes for governance and compliance I need to have a one beautiful platform on which these can be leave it so when you say purple fabric platform purple fabric platform is a platform in which all this governance can be done so you know who is using what because this knowledge which is sitting in a data cannot be given to everybody in the company it has to be given to the select set of people and what is required for the regulator he also needs a same kind of technology to be given to him so this kind of a platforms are important which is applied platform on the top of generative a platform so we work very collaboratively with AWS with aure with other llama to use their language models to make it Enterprise grade for Enterprise to use financial institution to use it yeah and I think what's interesting is when you talk about everything's on the one platform yeah so let's go I mean it's no surprise uh banking is extremely fastpaced especially now with these new technologies and it's competitive so how can Banks ensure that rapid transition from ideation to production but at the same time meet any challenges that come their way and optimize opportunities and here's the key word quickly quickly yeah yeah I think this is a key word but I'm slightly proponent of saying I need to have a cartographic view of Next 5year plan and then I will keep fixing each component one by one so I design a 20 story building and I move every 3 months into one one one floor but designing the 20 story building should be done together rather than a random working so that's why we propose that today there is a possibility of composability and contextuality you can design a compose a solution in every 12 weeks you can compose a particular solution for a particular segment for the customer by having a codeless platform so termeric is our codess platform we use and we have 329 microservices some 1700 apis and 500 events now with this composability we can provide that in every 12 weeks we can provide one value product to the customer but we would like to work with the customer in a more 20 uh quarter program 5 years program but divided into 20 deliveries floor by floor floor by floor working with the customer floor by flooor well Aaron thank you so much it's been enlightening and it as we said earlier this is such a fastpaced environment so it's great to hear about all these Technologies and increasing communication as well thank you it's so beautiful to have these questions which are burning questions of most of the bankers when I I was having a buy conference last week and I was addressing the complex how do you simplify the banking Yeah by reducing complexity and what your questions are in line with the similar question when they ask me the question thank you f for asking such question it's a pleasure and thank you Aaron yeah
[Music] I'm Arun Jan uh founder chairman of intellect design Arena working in financial technology industry from last 38 years [Music] design thinking evolved in 1992 when I was visiting Silicon Valley during 2007 I found there's a difference between management thinking and design thinking so management thinking is about maximization and optimization of the resources while design thinking is about understanding the unmet needs and desires of the customer and create the opportunity out of it from there it comes a first principal thinking where you look at the algorithm why particular thing is required and from why what how part emerges is the first principal [Music] thinking so design thinking and first principal thinking is about simplifying Banking and Financial technology so you know Financial technology is the first adopter of the computer in 1960s and this is the wave one of the main frame second wave was from mini computers then distributed computing then internet Computing and then now cloud computing now in this five wayes we got into the complexity complexity complexity and design thinking helps in understanding the core value of the banking systems where we distill that what are the core value customer is looking for how we can support by the organizing the right thinking space then expanding the performance Space by Frameworks and by the Design Systems and then impacting the business outcome this is the way once we impact from technology to business outcome which is a core value of the financial technology industry that's what makes a [Music] difference now em. let me explain what is the em. em. a is D from why Bank exist Bank exist because there's a financial event happen in the life of the customer or a corporate that is for IT stand for E Bank provides a response to that event which is a service it provides and when we embed that service into technology it's called microservice this service cannot work alone it works with the other services and that contract is called API and it sits on a cloud which is the fourth alphabet of EAC or AI is a cloud now it has to have a human interaction which is called H so em. a e stand for event M for microservice a for API C for cloud H for headless and then aai means you're making intelligent so now this is a complete intelligent systems to be designed for banking transformation experience design operational excellence all three things come into picture by em. and which is evolved from first principal thinking because we ask the fundamental question why Bank exist but it exists for savings lending payments so and transactions so that's where the role become very very simple and we wired the knowledge using our cartographic view of design [Music] thinking typically in financial sector they are product companies which are only selling core banking lending wealth and credit card a four system theyel now you need a four databases separately so but customer needs are savings lending credit card and wealth all are his basic needs so in a microservice architecture where we broken down into 329 microservices 1,757 apis and 500 events we are able to compose the solution which is around customer if there's a segment which is agriculture segment which is a trading seor which is manufacturing we can design a offering and solution based on the customer need and that's how the power of you got [Music] AI listen to the customer he's empath empathizing with the customer you're finding the desirability of the customer and based on his desirability we writing the user Journey from user Journey while mapping to the Eco e system or financial ecosystem where I'm connected to the open banking system so since e. a is the most comprehensive open finance platform which is composable and intelligent then it is much easier for me to wire his desirability to his experience which results into a higher profit for the bank and lower cost for the operations [Music] in Europe and America the complexity of product Centric organization on a one dimension and Technology complexity on second dimension it's a two- dimensional complexity by using first principle thinking and em. a we are eliminating those thinking process starting from capturing the events and it can reduce the technology cost by 30% my operational we our promise of using. is how do you do you reduce a bank if they have a $100 million cost how do you reduce $30 million cost by adopting cloud and intellect design arena. a so that is our promise to the customer [Music]
