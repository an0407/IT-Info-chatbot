[Music] [Music] thanks a lot first of all for inviting me to that short testimonial and um well I'm in charge of the it at Luan Caro joining seio in 2015 Luan cargo is one of the leading airr carriers in the world we are ranking a very top um on volume and also on quality and on network uh with about 300 stations we serve worldwide with a huge transport capacity of a dedicated fer Fleet but also the um Bellys of Luft hanza and other luans group carriers and um we have the the Strategic ambition to lead the digitalization in the industry whether it's pricing quotation capacity management booking or also handling fulfillment and also the flight operations it is now integral part of all our business processes yeah without without it we can't book we can't handle we can't flight any shipments any longer and um we have basically two strategic main objectives first is to um become a digital company for digital booking digital pricing digital Revenue management and second what we call is digital F fillment so get rid of all the paper really improve the processes by automation by digitalization to improve quality and uh provide a seamless transport Journey for our clients from the original um shipper to the final [Music] con what was extremely special to the whole airline industry was of course the extreme uncertainty how will that pandemic evolve yeah I remember well when we had the first crisis meetings in February and March when basically all the airlines across the world got more or less completely grounded only very few few planes still in the air all other companies within a few days only were for to work remotely as far as he could so also some business departments which never never could imagine to work from remote to access critical applications from home had to be enabled to uh get remote access at a sudden um we all understood again the extremely important role of airr in the global Supply chains this started in March already and with a peak in April for medical supply person prodection like masks Like Oxygen supply and so then later last year we understood that uh there is a huge uh bottleneck in supply for for example electronic spare parts any kind of equipment which was also locked somewhere in the harbors because also the um ocean freighter where uh um were uh locked down and uh the key ch challenge for our whole operations was simply to bring as much C capacity as possible in the air we have refurbished some of our passenger planes as a freighter we call them brers yeah we took out the passenger seats to be able to load also a bike Freight in the um main deck where usually the pass passengers are sitting and in the end it was extremely um cumbersome operations we had a lot of travel restrictions for our cruise we could not do the layovers in China for example or the us as initially planned due to immigration restrictions also for cruise it was an extremely instable operations and an extremely high demand for Air Freight and uh we had to somehow deal with that and um to do the best for our clients to um to keep up a stable supply chain this required a lot of creativity and also shortterm uh actions to to um keep our operations up and [Music] running the whole 20120 and to be fair I don't expect 2021 to be very very different was extremely vuka yeah so we uh had to react at very short notice we had to adjust our systems sometimes within days only um and at the same time also the it teams where forced to work from home we could not travel any longer to meet the teams in person um and so besides all the capabilities to react at very short notice the second huge challenge for simply to keep the operations up and running uh stable and performant um in the day-to-day business the Enterprise service BOS short ESB is our Central middleware it is something like the central Nerf system between all our applications yeah Luan cargo has it landscape of about 80 applications with something like thousand interfaces between the applications all these interfaces are running on the ESB and mry as our partner to maintain to run but also to develop and further uh uh change the ESB here is a reliable partner uh a scalable and trustworth partner to to um simply support the ESB operations in the background sometimes a little bit unfair just to talk about the background or underground ESB but whenever we have a trouble um then the whole business process impacted and this is why it's so extremely important really to have here a reliable and a competent and scalable partner I would say first of all it's extremely high commitment and reliability yeah from day one mry really convinced us on their capabilities I was really deeply astonished and I don't say that every time on the way you took over the service from us it was performed in a highly professional manner and well usually it project tend to last longer than initially plan this was one of the very very few projects in my personal history which actually could be completed faster than planned and not only faster but also at a very very high quality and Following also the approach mry has proposed to us on the professional takeover of the existing service and then now we are in operations for more than two years now in the current setup also the high commitment and Prof professionality um we see how you deliver service how you also um provide transparency on what is going on and um mry is a partner we can fully rely on also in good and also in not that good times as the whole airline industry is currently phasing if I sh MYRY in three words it's professional it's commitment and its reliability [Music] [Music] you
