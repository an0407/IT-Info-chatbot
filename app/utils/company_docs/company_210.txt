is all about identifying and fulfilling emerging, individual customer needs.
With it comes specific questions nearly every organization will have to answer:

Will our digital commerce goals require a change in the architectural framework?
Will our technology architecture and infrastructure models scale to support our digital commerce goals?

to support a more engaging retail experience?
