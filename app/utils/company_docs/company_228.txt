foreign I am a principal in the data practice supporting the Google Cloud unit at LTI many businesses today find it's beneficial to move its data to the cloud advantages such as operating cars elasticity to scale up or down based on business needs inbuilt security highly performant analytics platform are some of the key decision drivers while moving your data to the cloud one should be aware and avoid common pitfalls for example while migrating your in-house data it's a great opportunity to re-evaluate if your legacy data model still represents an optimized model for your current data needs if not it is the best time to take care of that another item is the storage cost Google close bigquery gives you multiple levels of storage facilities for example highly available operational data access versus low frequency data access which may be needed only on a monthly or early basis this will help you avoid overpaying for data storage on the cloud while your business case does not warrant it bigquery also provides a query language format that is highly compatible and similar to relational database sequels this will help reduce any re-education of existing developers but as many of us seen before often in Legacy implementations queries are written in large convoluted fashion like a single query with thousand plus lines or a query with many table joins that takes hours to execute my suggestion is to Port them to the latest BQ SQL format for execution time and efficiency of cost [Music] in LTI we have several accelerators like the canvas Eureka that can help reduce your cost of migration and timeline for such migrations as well while we maintain the quality and security of your data Eureka 2 contains various components like analyzer that can analyze your Source data and produce a report migrator that can help automate migration of your source and metadata along with queries and functions a validation framework that can help with post migration validation and finally an a enabled quality and data governance framework that can help Monitor and optimize your data post migration thank you and have a good day foreign [Music]
