Title: Infosys Careers - Culture
            content: Diversity and Inclusion
Welcome to a meritocracy of ideas.
If an innovation has to serve a diverse set of people, it has to come from people of diverse backgrounds. It’s that simple. That’s why we have people from all walks of life – of different interests, genders, and orientations from over 150 nationalities, operating out of over 56 countries. Come, be defined by your skills, ideas and attitude, not your ability, race, sexuality, or nationality.
